/>
```

> **Note:**
>
> - We have added `family` prop for `Icon` class, please make sure that you pass the props

- **Custom Icons**

> **Note:**
> Since we are using native libraries, we have not found a solution in order to render RN Images in production, therefore please copy all your image assets in platform specific folders:

- Android: Please copy your image assets in app resource drawable folder
- iOS: Please copy your image assets in app resources folder

> Please refer example application for the image usage.

- Starring and sharing the projects you like üöÄ
